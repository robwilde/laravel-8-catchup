    What? Good morning. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man
    really came through it worked. Lorenzo, where're you keys?
</p><p>
    What? Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Whoa, wait, Doc. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy
    ever have hair? Breakfast.
</p><p>
    Looks like a airplane, without wings. What was it, George, bird watching? God dammit, I'm late. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry
    with me. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time?
